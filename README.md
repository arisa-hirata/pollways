### What is Pollways?
The application will allow users to post arguments which other users can agree, disagree, or comment on. It is a polling and debate app that helps to resolve debates between other users. It is an application for the person who always has to be right.

With a team of four, my role in Pollways was a Lead Developer. As a lead developer of the project, I was responsible for taking the mockups from the design team, and developing the UI/UX in React Native and Redux. I also worked with the other developer in implementing firebase. At the end of the term, we presented the project to our peers and a panel of industry representatives, and we competed with the other 9 teams throughh voting by industries and other grades, and our app was chosen as the one of the best app in this year.

### Challenges
This project was the biggest and the most challenging project in my BCIT days. All of the technologies, such as ReactNative, Redux, and firebase were completely new for me. And as a lead developer, I needed to direct other teammates, as well as struggle with the new technology. Basically, my efforts and skills were equivalent to the app quality, which means I took on great responsibility alone. I was under so much pressure every day, and I became discouraged many times. However, I have never stopped working hard, and I have been keeping my best, until the last moment.
